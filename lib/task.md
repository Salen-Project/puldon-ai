Design a futuristic, elegant, and intelligent AI Financial Advisor app interface called FinSage — a next-generation personal finance companion that blends cutting-edge AI insights with a luxurious, modern aesthetic.

The theme should feel premium and futuristic, mixing deep midnight blue, emerald green, and neon cyan gradients with soft glassmorphism and glowing accent effects. The overall vibe should communicate trust, intelligence, and empowerment — like the user is speaking to their personal digital financial mentor.

Core Screens:
	1.	Dashboard (Home Screen)
	•	A glowing circular card showing predicted income for next month with animated percentage arcs and confidence rings.
	•	Below it, interactive cards for “Spending,” “Savings Goals,” “Subscriptions,” and “Alerts” with smooth hover and floating effects.
	•	AI-generated insights appear in a chat bubble: “Your income might drop 12% next month. Consider saving $150 more.”
	•	Include small holographic icons for quick actions (Add Transaction, View Chart, Ask AI).
	2.	AI Chat & Voice Assistant
	•	A chat interface with elegant speech bubbles — the AI side glows softly with animated waveforms when speaking.
	•	Microphone button at the bottom for real-time voice queries, animated with pulsing waves.
	•	Background subtly shifts hues depending on conversation mood (cooler tones for info, warmer for encouragement).
	3.	Financial Goals Panel
	•	Visually stunning goal tracker: crystal-like progress bars or 3D coins filling up as savings grow.
	•	Each goal card (e.g., Wedding Fund, Car, House) displays target, saved amount, and dynamic projection lines based on AI predictions.
	4.	Income Prediction & Analysis Screen
	•	Interactive line chart with neon trails showing past and future income trends.
	•	A small glowing AI icon hovers beside it, offering “Why” explanations (e.g., Seasonal change detected).
	5.	Subscription & Budget Manager
	•	Sleek list with logos (Netflix, Spotify, etc.) auto-detected, each glowing subtly by brand color.
	•	AI warning banners: “You’ve reached 82% of your Food budget.”
	•	Option toggles like “Pause Subscription,” “Suggest Cheaper Alternative.”
	6.	Profile & Settings
	•	Minimalistic user profile with avatar inside a luminous ring.
	•	Toggles for Dark/Light mode, AI voice selection, financial risk level.
	7.	Loading & Transitions
	•	Elegant animated transitions: light streaks, blur morphs, soft zooms.
	•	On startup: the FinSage logo forms from a swirl of glowing particles.

Overall Style Guide:
	•	Typography: sleek sans-serif, geometric yet elegant (e.g., Poppins, Exo 2, or Satoshi).
	•	Icons: line-based with faint glow; smooth micro-animations.
	•	Buttons: rounded corners, frosted glass effect, hover glows.
	•	Animations: soft, fluid — inspired by AI motion (like intelligence visualized).

The entire interface should feel alive, responsive, and deeply personalized, as though the app understands the user’s habits, goals, and emotions.
